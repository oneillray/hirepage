## This is a hire me page that I'm working on.

I'm ridiculously bad and designing in the open or even sharing my work so this is my attempt at improving that.
Hire me page for madebyray


Some of my goals for this project are:

1. Create a quick, simple and to the point hire page for me to send to perspective clients
2. The aim is to ship quickly and often and iterate on what I have done.
3. Question every design decision, and section I put on the site.


### Website sections

1. Intro 
2. Skills / Services
3. CTA
4. Client Testimonials
5. My work - directly links to projects for now, with the intention of have case-study pages for each project
6. About
7. Contact

# inuit.css web template

This is the inuit.css web template; the wrapper for the popular
[inuit.css](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css) framework.

This template is a barebones and unopinionated directory structure which simply
allows you to include the inuit.css core library in your builds as an updatable
Git submodule.

To quickly install inuit.css, run the following commands:

    $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:csswizardry/inuit.css-web-template.git your-project-folder
    $ cd your-project-folder
    $ ./go

What we are doing here is cloning an instance of the inuit.css-web-template and
its submodules (thatâ€™s what the `--recursive` does) into a directory which you
specify. Next we `cd` into that directory and run [our `go` script](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css-web-template/blob/master/go).
This script (courtesy of [Nick Payne](http://twitter.com/makeusabrew)) simply
removes the web templateâ€™s Git instance and replaces it with a fresh one for
your project, whilst also maintaining your inuit.css submodule.

For a more detailed overview on what inuit.css is, and how to install and use
it, please refer to the documentation in the README in
[the main inuit.css repository](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css).
