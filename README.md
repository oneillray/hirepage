## Madebyray.com - Portfolio of Ray O'Neill - Freelance Designer & Front-End Developer.


## This is a hire me page that I'm working on.

I'm ridiculously bad and designing in the open or even sharing my work so this is my attempt at improving that.
Hire me page for madebyray


Some of my goals for this project are:

1. Create a quick, simple and to the point hire page for me to send to perspective clients
2. The aim is to ship quickly and often and iterate on what I have done.
3. Question every design decision, and section I put on the site.


### Website sections

1. Intro 
2. Skills / Services
3. CTA
4. Client Logos
5. My work - directly links to projects for now, with the intention of have case-study pages for each project
6. About
7. Contact
