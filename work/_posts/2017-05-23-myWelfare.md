##### User Persona
Through user research I defined the user archetype that helped to guide in making product features, navigations and design decisions. Here is the persona that was created for this project.

##### User Scenario

In this scenario, I have written specifically for our persona, Ceighlan. I have described the ideal situation provide a clear way of picturing the behaviour of a user and the actions taken by the user.
