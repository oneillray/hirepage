### The Brief

The brief was to create to give life to the client's clever business idea of creating a service to help Irish teacher move to Australia to find work. In addition to this, my job was to create an attractive and professional website for potential customers of Ozteach, where they could get information about the service, register their interest to buy the service & learn more about the companies team.

### Personal Project Goals

As with every project I take, I like to set personal goals that I set out to reach by the the end of the project. For this project, implementing a responsive design for the Wordpress website was important to me. In addition to this I wanted to learn how to use technologies such as [SASS](), [CODEKIT](), [Wordpress]() frameworks such as [Bones](). I also want to experiment with [GIT]() and proper website deployment using [Beanstalk](http://beanstalkapp.com/).

On the design side of things, I wanted to strengthen my typography skills. I find typography extremely difficult aspect of design and so I wanted to use this project as an excuse to expand my type knowledge. I used [Typecast]() for the first time in this project and found it to be a hugely important web-design tool.
