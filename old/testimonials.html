<p>Ray was so efficient we ‘threw him into the deep end’, to undertake client meetings, provide CMS training and to help lead internal design discussion, especially related to digital design… His client liaison skills were characterised by seemingly infinite patience and good humour, always willing to go ‘the extra mile’ to support clients and others in our studio.</p>

<p>Peter Struck - Director [<em>Struck &amp; Spink Design Studio](http://struckandspink.com.au</em>)</p>

<p>“Ray proved himself to be accurate, creative and organised, constantly meeting and exceeding tight targets in an efficient manner. In the last 6 months of his employment here, Ray was also involved in UI design for online and mobile front-end products. This gave Ray an increased opportunity to show creativity and design flair, which he undoubtedly possesses, and he transitioned smoothly into this more creative role.” </p>

<p>Andrew - Communication Design Manager [<em>Paddy Power](http://paddypower.com</em>)</p>

<p>“Ray is a creative, bright and personable individual. He is highly self-motivated and well capable of achieving any goal he sets his mind to. Ray’s quick understanding of how to act as a team member in a very busy and hard working studio is a testimony of his resolve and superb working attitude.” </p>
