			<blockqoute>Ray was so efficient we ‘threw him into the deep end’, to undertake client meetings, provide CMS training and to help lead internal design discussion, especially related to digital design… His client liaison skills were characterised by seemingly infinite patience and good humour, always willing to go ‘the extra mile’ to support clients and others in our studio.</blockqoute>

			<blockqoute>Ray proved himself to be accurate, creative and organised, constantly meeting and exceeding tight targets in an efficient manner. In the last 6 months of his employment here, Ray was also involved in UI design for online and mobile front-end products. This gave Ray an increased opportunity to show creativity and design flair, which he undoubtedly possesses, and he transitioned smoothly into this more creative role.</blockqoute>
