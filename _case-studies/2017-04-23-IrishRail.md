## Project Aim

The project was born out of our experiences of frustration from  using irish-rail services. To further, we need Irish rail touched the lives of millions of irish citizens so we wanted to listen, understand and improve their experience. 


## Project Approach

#### There was only eight weeks to carry out research, test a prototype and iterate on a final design. Our process was first to understand who Irish Rail customers were, the problems they were having and the top things they needed the online services to do.  From there, we defined the problem. Next we hypothesised some solutions and tested those designs as interactive prototypes. Finally, we learned what worked and what needed improving.


1. Understand the users of irishrail.ie and their needs
2. Define the problem statement.
3. Identify the major pain points with irishrail.ie
4. Prototype & test a new solution

### 1. Understanding Rail Customers

We used surveys, interviews to help understand the needs of Irish rail customers. To first understand who the types of customers were we design an online survey and distributed to friends and family and through social media. 




### Main Problems

1. Lack of quality time spent with job officer
2. Lack of awareness of the information & services that are already available
2. Frustrations with Social Welfare as a Service



### 2. Define


#### User Persona

Through user research I defined the user archetype that helped to guide in making product features, navigations and design decisions. Here is the persona that was created for this project.

#### User Scenario

A huge benefit of user scenarios is that it creates a narrative that can help create understanding for stakeholders around the problem that is being solved. In this scenario, I have written specifically for our persona, Ceighlan. I have described the ideal situation provide a clear way of picturing the behaviour of a user and the actions taken by the user.
