## Overview

There was only eight weeks to carry out research, test a prototype and iterate on a final design. Our process was first to understand who Irish Rail customers were, the problems they were having and the top things they needed the online services to do. From there, we defined the problem. Next we hypothesised some solutions around booking a train & checking train times and tested those designs as interactive prototypes. Finally, we learned what worked and what didn't work so.

## Project Objectives

1. Understand the users of irishrail.ie and their needs
2. Define the problem statement.
3. Identify the major pain points with irishrail.ie
4. Prototype & test a new solution

## Phase 1: Understanding the users

The main reason for gathering data at all is to glean information about something [^Preece, J., Rogers, Y., & Sharp, H. 2015]. In order to know we we needed to research, we first needed to derive at research goals. I listed out what we needed answered before we could define what what I was designing and who for. Here are the main research goals I set out for the project:

1. Identify any usability or user experience issues and any barriers / drivers to use.
2. Understand current behaviour and experience of Irish Rail user
3. Identify any usability issues when booking a train online.
4. Evaluate the top user tasks of the Irish Rail website.
5. Evaluate the efficiency of the Irish Rail website and measure it against user experience. 

Interviews were done with **6 participants** in total. From our initial survey research we learned that there was about a 50/50 split in leisure travellers and commuters so we decided to talk to both as part of research.

### Observation

One of the best ways to understand people’s experiences is to see them for ourselves [^Kuniavsky, 2012]. Direct observation was carried out in a controlled environment on interview participants so that we could fully understand the issues that the users were having and to see how they carried out a specific task.

<h3> Card Sorting </h3>

<p>We then asked our interviewees to sort the cards from top to bottom going from most important to least important to their needs

### Main Problems

1. Major UI Issues
2. Reserving Seats
3. Booking Process


## Phase 2: Defining our users & gathering requirements

#### User Persona

Through user research I defined the user archetype that helped to guide in making product features, navigations and design decisions. Here is the persona that was created for this project.

<img src="https://n00162913.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/persona.jpg?w=739" alt="">

#### User Scenario

> This is John. He’s 26 and works in Cork as IT professional. John’s from Galway and goes home to visit family and friends usually once a month. John generally purchase his ticket in advance of travel often during work. He also does some planning through the Irish Rail website such as checking train times and prices. John also books a return ticket altogether he needs to flexibility because his plans might change. John expects booking a train online to be swift and simple, especially if he has to do it nearly every month. John is frustrated by the fact he needs to collect a physical ticket for a something he paid for online. John also, finds it annoying when he does not get the seat he selected.

## 3. Ideation + Prototyping

We had about one week to conceptualise and test the first iteration of prototype. Our first port of call was to work out the all the features that are required so that the user can carry out tasks using the website. 

We utilised [Jobs to be do ](https://www.intercom.com/books/jobs-to-be-done) from Intercom to help use figure out what some of these task might look like.

1. **When** I commute, **I want** to know the departure times quickly, **so I won't** miss my train.
2. **When** I go home for the weekend, **I want to** be able to book a open ticket, **so that I can** have some flexibility on what time return.
3. **When** I book a train ticket, **I want to** be able to a specific seat, **so I know it** be suitable for my needs.

From here we mapped out how the user journey might look like by co-designing the user flow by way of white boarding.

Once we had a general idea of the user journey we  began to work in paper for our first iteration so it meant that we could quickly try now ideas and not become attached to them if they didn't work.

For specific user interface challenges we used crazy eights from the [Sprint book](http://www.gv.com/sprint/) to quickly conceptualise many different solutions to one piece of user interface.

Next we used [Axure](https://www.axure.com/) to create a user flow and start bringing some interactivity so that we carry out our first user tests.

## Phase 4: User Validation + Iteration

Through user testing on two iterations of the prototype the following issues emerged:

- Seat selection was found to be confusing
- Users didn't get any error messages when issues occurred in the user interface and found labelling to be confusing. 
- Users had trouble distinguishing between outbound and return journeys.
- User is unsure if seat location is selected
- User felt that that the system was too restrictive and didn't allow them to change journey details during the purchase path

#### Selecting seats

Our seat selection feature still caused pain to our users. First, the users we unsure as to what direction a seats were facing, secondly the were unsure as to what facilities we available close to that seat. To overcome this, we presented two different solutions help ease this problem.

#### User interface issues

It was evident from our first usability test that there was clear labelling issues especially around the main call to action on our ‘live times’ ‘times only and ‘add ticket’. We resolved these issues in iteration two however, we then experienced the issue of the user clicking the wrong call to action for purchasing a ticket.  In iteration 3, we resolved this by keeping the secondary CTAs inline with the form give to more visual prominence to the ‘check times & prices’ button.

#### Distinguishing journey details

Another thing that emerged from testing was that the users were not sure of which column of results for the outward journey and which for the return journey. In addition, they were confused when the user saw open return the did not know to click it or when they had clicked it it they were unsure of what to do next.

![](https://n00162913.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/screenshot-2017-02-06-00-15-46.png&w=357&h=253)

We resolved this in the second iteration by introduction a journey details area on the right hand side that would populate as the user makes their outward and return journey selection.
