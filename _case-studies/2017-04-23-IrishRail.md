## Project Aim

The project was born out of our experiences of frustration from  using irish-rail services. To further, we need Irish rail *touched the lives of millions of irish citizens so we wanted* to listen, understand and improve their experience. 


## Project Approach

There was only eight weeks to carry out research, test a prototype and iterate on a final design. Our process was first to understand who Irish Rail customers were, the problems they were having and the top things they needed the online services to do.  From there, we defined the problem. Next we hypothesised some solutions and tested those designs as interactive prototypes. Finally, we learned what worked and what needed improving.


## Process

1. Understand the users of irishrail.ie and their needs
2. Define the problem statement.
3. Identify the major pain points with irishrail.ie
4. Prototype & test a new solution

## 1. Understanding the users

We used surveys, interviews to help understand the needs of Irish rail customers. To first understand who the types of customers were we design an online survey and distributed to friends and family and through social media.

The main reason for gathering data at all is to glean information about something (Preece, J., Rogers, Y., & Sharp, H. 2015). In order to know we we needed to research, we first needed to derive at research goals. Decided as a team, a list was made of what we get answered before we could define what we were designing and who for. Here are the main research goals we set out for the project:

1. Identify any usability or user experience issues and any barriers / drivers to use.
2. Understand current behaviour and experience of Irish Rail user
3. Identify any usability issues when booking a train online.
4. Evaluate the top user tasks of the Irish Rail website.
5. Evaluate the efficiency of the Irish Rail website and measure it against user experience. 

Our main research goals was to understand the current behaviour and experience of Irish Rail user we decided to interview both types of user to get a better understanding of how their goals and frustrations, and needs differed and if there we and overlap in the two that could present opportunities to solve problems for both while focusing on the one user type.We carried our interviews with 6 participants in total. We chosen to interview 6 Leisure users and 4 Commuters.

### Observation

One of the best ways to understand people’s experiences is to see them for ourselves (Kuniavsky, 2012). Direct observation was carried out in a controlled environment on interview participants so that we could fully understand the issues that the users were having and to see how they carried out a specific task.

<h3> Card Sorting </h3>

<p>We then asked our interviewees to sort the cards from top to bottom going from most important to least important to their needs

### Main Problems

1. Major UI Issues
2. Reserving Seats
3. Booking Process





## Define our users & gathering requirments


#### User Persona

Through user research I defined the user archetype that helped to guide in making product features, navigations and design decisions. Here is the persona that was created for this project.

#### User Scenario

>This is John. He’s 26 and works in Cork as IT professional. John’s from Galway and goes home to visit family and friends usually once a month. John generally purchase his ticket in advance of travel often during work. He also does some planning through the Irish Rail website such as checking train times and prices. John also books a return ticket altogether he needs to flexibility because his plans might change. John expects booking a train online to be swift and simple, especially if he has to do it nearly every month. John is frustrated by the fact he needs to collect a physical ticket for a something he paid for online.  John also, finds it annoying when he does not get the seat he selected.

### 3. Ideation + Prototyping

We used crazy eights were used to quickly conceptualise many different solutions to one piece of user interface.
