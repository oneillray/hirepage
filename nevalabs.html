<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>Éilis, Áine &amp; Mark,</p>

<p>I am writing to you to apply for the UX Researcher position at Nevalabs. I have been following the work that your team has been doing since forming in <a href="https://medium.com/neva-labs/notes-on-a-new-beginning-3b844831bbd4">October</a>. Having worked in one of Ireland's tops news organisations for the past three years, I see first-hand the growing pressure that is on the news industry. I'm really excited about what you are building in Nevalbabs and the ambitions to create a 'purpose driven' personalisation product. I'm also very excited to hear the news of the company <a href="https://nevalabshq.com/blog/2018/5/30/the-roadmap-to-a-more-civil-form-of-discourse-and-discovery">joining with a blockchain partner</a>.</p>

<p>I'm really keen early to be part of your journey.In your blog you mention a lot about treating news like a fitness tracker, I'm also really interested in this topic. So much so that I am doing my MSc thesis on topic. You can read more about that <a href="https://madebyray.com/nevalabs">here</a>. </p>

<p>The opportunity to continue to gain insights about user attitudes &amp; behaviours around news and ultimately launch something that can have a lasting social impact attracts me hugely to this role. The chance to continue carrying on with the work I am exploring in my thesis topic in an industry environment is very attractive prospect also. </p>

<p>Finally, my keen interest in new personalisation, my relevelant experience carrying out research and my ability to translate findings into actionable insights makes me an ideal candidate for this role.</p>

<p>Regards,<br/>
Ray</p>
