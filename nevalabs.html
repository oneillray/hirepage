<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>Hey √âilis, √Åine &amp; Mark üëã</p>

<p>I think it's time that we work together. I have been following the work that your team has been doing since forming in <a href="https://medium.com/neva-labs/notes-on-a-new-beginning-3b844831bbd4">last October</a>. Having worked in one of Ireland's tops news organisations for the past three years, I see first-hand the growing pressure that is on the industry. I am really excited about what you are building in Nevalabs and the ambition to create a 'purpose driven' personalisation product. I am also very excited to hear the news about the company joining with a <a href="https://nevalabshq.com/blog/2018/5/30/the-roadmap-to-a-more-civil-form-of-discourse-and-discovery">joining us with a blockchain startup</a>. Nice move! </p>

<p>I am really keen to be a part of the Nevalabs journey. In your blog you mention the idea of treating news ‚Äúlike a fitness tracker‚Äù. I find this idea really interesting, so much that I am doing my MSc thesis on the topic. You can read more about it <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/MSc-Thesis-U5NCZJltOUnEOnVYOLFc7#:h2=RQ:--Can-persuasive-design-pat">here</a>. </p>

<p>The opportunity to continue gaining insights about user attitudes &amp; behaviours around news and ultimately launching a product that can have a lasting social impact, are two key aspects that attracts me to this role. The possibility of being able to continue developing and researching the work that I am exploring in my thesis topic in an industry environment will be of great benefit to the company‚Äôs development.</p>

<p>With my research experience and huge interest in news personalisation, I think the ideal candidate for this role. </p>

<p>Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>

Ray</p>
