<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>Hey √âilis, √Åine &amp; Mark üëã</p>

<p>I think it's time that we work together. I have been following the what your team has been up to since forming <a href="https://medium.com/neva-labs/notes-on-a-new-beginning-3b844831bbd4">last October</a>. I worked in a news organisation for the past three years so I can see first-hand the growing pressure that is on this industry. I am really excited about what you are building in Nevalabs and the ambition you have to create a 'purpose driven' personalisation product. I am also very excited to hear the news about the company joining <a href="https://nevalabshq.com/blog/2018/5/30/the-roadmap-to-a-more-civil-form-of-discourse-and-discovery"> with a blockchain startup</a>. Nice move! </p>

<p>I am really keen to be a part of the Nevalabs journey. In your blog you mention the idea of treating news ‚Äúlike a fitness tracker‚Äù. I find this idea really interesting, so much that I am doing my MSc thesis on the topic. You can read more about it <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/MSc-Thesis-U5NCZJltOUnEOnVYOLFc7#:h2=RQ:--Can-persuasive-design-pat">here</a>. </p>

<p>I would love the opportunity to work in this field and continue gaining insights about user attitudes &amp; behaviours around news. I also believe that the area that I am exploring in my thesis will be of great benefit to the company‚Äôs development too </p>

<p>With my research experience and huge interest in news personalisation, I think that I am an ideal candidate for this role. </p>

<p>Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>

Ray</p>
